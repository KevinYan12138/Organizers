# Organizers

This is the source code of an app that has been published to both app store and play store. This app aims to help organization managers to manage events with ease. Managers can create, edit, and delete events while members can view them in the in-app calendar. They can also chat with each other and create chat groups. 

This app is built with Flutter using dart. All of its data is stored in Google Cloud using Firebase.
